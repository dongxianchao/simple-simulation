# simple-simulation
This is a simple program I wrote for molecular dynamics simulations, intended solely for learning purposes.
Now it supports calculations using the LJ potential, EAM potential and EAM/alloy potential. For specific input formats, you can refer to my 'incar' file.

lately I updated some new functions and I solved some bugs. 


TO DO:
I'm implementing a thermostat and barostat algorithm to control both temperature and pressure during the simulation.
